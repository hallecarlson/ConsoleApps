    Project Name:   RPG
    File Name:      RPGcopy.cpp
    Purpose:        

    Pseudocode:     
      
    Requirements:       Up-to-date  Comment section (Green text in beginning of file), Comments used throughout code
                        Done        Intro and clear instructions, easy to use interface
                        Done        Simple dungeon with 25 rooms minimum
                        In progress 4 NPCs minimum
                        In progress NPC interactions effective and consistent (I/O, branching, looping, classes)
                        Up-to-date  Option mechanics effective (branching), game loops and other loops effective (looping)
                        In progress Strings to hold appropriate data (addressing user by name, holding NPC responses, other 
                                        canned output that may be used multiple times (strings)
                        Up-to-date  Functions used appropriately (passing correct arguments and returning correct values 
                                        (for intro and interactions at least), rooms and interactions)
                        (Check)
                        Many errors Game works (beginning, middle, end), replayable with entertainment value, has error checking
                        In progress Uses structs or classes for player stats and other places as appropriate (struct/classes)
                        (Must be checked and tested)
                        In progress Uses vectors as appropriate (NPCs saved to vectors at least)
                        (Must be finished and tested)
                        In progress Uses object-oriented programming (NPCs should transition from being structs to classes, 
                                        classes should be used in some way if not for NPCs
                        (Must be tested)
                        Done        Use files for save states, use at checkpoints of at will, user may start new game or continue old game
                        (Must be tested)
                        Not done    Game thoroughly tested by at least 4 others who fill out 5-question questionnaire that I create


    Notes:              implement save states, 
                        fix death messages
                        edit vectors to what they need to be
                        change npc interactions to strings
                        get game to shut down and delete save data after death
                        ask Mr. Miyoshi if enemy needs to be in a vector and how to do that if so
                        test
