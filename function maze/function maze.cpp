    File Name:      function maze.cpp
    Purpose:        Write a program that uses functions for the rooms of a maze. The maze should have 
                    beginning and ending points. Between are rooms that can be traversed via your own 
                    system. The best way to do the maze is not to call rooms from other rooms but to 
                    have a loop in the main() function and call the rooms based on a room available. 
                    Your maze must have a minimum of 12 rooms and the user may travel to each one. You 
                    may have one path or multiple paths that get you to the exit.
