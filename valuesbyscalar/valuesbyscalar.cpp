    Problem:        Write a program that declares an integer vector of 50 elements. (Use a loop to populate 
                    the vector with consecutive or random numbers.) Then use the fact that scalar multiplication 
                    of matrices (vectors) is simply the multiplication of each element in the matrix by the given 
                    scalar. Let the user input a number (scalar) that will be used to multiply the matrix (vector). 
                    Then multiply the matrix by that number. Output the new vector values to the screen.
