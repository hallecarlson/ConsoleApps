    File Name:      fortune cookie.cpp
    Purpose:        Write a program that is passed a number and possibly a string and gives the user a     
                    fortune. You will decide which fortune, of ten possible, based on the number that is
                    passed to the function. Then, the function will pass the fortune back to the calling
                    function. Output the fortune in the calling function. You must loop the program (in 
                    main()) so that the user can keep getting fortunes until opting to quit. As an extension,
                    use a random number to determine the number you pass to the function instead of getting
                    the number from the user.
