    Project Name:   Problem GS07-02
    File Name:      personaldata.cpp
    Purpose:        Write a program that gets personal data from the user. The personal data will 
                    be held in a struct that has first name, middle name, last name (all three strings), 
                    age, and phone number (also a string). You may add more data to your struct. Get the 
                    data from the user, then output the data to the user who will make sure it is correct.
                    If not correct, the user should input the data again. If the data is correct, you can
                    tell the user the data will be handled with the utmost care. As an extension, send the
                    data in a struct from a function to the calling function (main()).

    Pseudocode:
