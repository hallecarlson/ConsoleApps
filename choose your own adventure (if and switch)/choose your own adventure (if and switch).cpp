    Project Name:   Problem GS03-04 (Choose your own adventure using if and switch)
    File Name:      choose your own adventure (if and switch).cpp
    Purpose:        Write a short choose your own adventure story.Address the user by name and tell the story from their perspective.
                    Give the user at least 3 places where the story will branch. The story will branch based on the user giving string
                    input in at least 2 places and int input in at least 1 place. There must be at least 9 endings, each with an appropriate 
                    ending. Either 2 levels of nesting with 3 choices at each level, or 3 levels of nesting with 2 choices at each level 
                    (one choice would have 3 instead of 2).

    Pseudocode:
